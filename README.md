# FlutterOCR  

FlutterOCR is a minimal implementation of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality using Flutter. This project demonstrates the basic setup and usage of Google's ML Kit for text recognition.  

## Features  

- Minimal codebase focusing on OCR implementation.  
- Demonstrates integration of ML Kit for text recognition in Flutter.  
- Provides a starting point for building OCR-based applications.  

## Disclaimer  

This repository contains only the core libraries and code snippets necessary to perform OCR. It is not a complete, runnable application. You will need to integrate it into a full Flutter application to use it effectively.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install): Install Flutter on your system.  
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart): Ensure Dart is installed.  

### Usage  

```bash  
1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/Mahmoud7Osman/FlutterOCR.git  

2. Navigate to the repository directory:  
   cd FlutterOCR  

3. Open the `lib` directory to explore the provided code snippets for OCR functionality.  

4. Integrate the code into your existing Flutter project:  
   - Copy the relevant files into your Flutter project.  
   - Ensure you have configured the required dependencies for ML Kit (see below).
